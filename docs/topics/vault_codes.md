# Vault Codes

In Geometry Dash 2.2 there are four different vaults you can access. The Vault, Vault of Secrets, Chamber of Time and The Wraith. Each vault has a select number of passwords that you can enter to unlock icons and colors. The Wraith is the first vault that is server-sided, meaning the rewards are checked on the server, they can change over time and can not be found by reverse engineering.

## Vault Code Encryption

The Vault: Codes are in plaintext and arent encrypted

Vault of Secrets and Chamber of time: [VaultCode] + ask2fpcaqCQ2 -> Xor with a key of 19283 -> base64 encode
