# RS, UUID and UDID

These are the parameters that can be frequently noticed when sending a request.

## RS

RS stands for Random Seed, or Random String, which is essentially just a string containing *n* (often *10*) random alphanumeric characters.
RS is mainly sent as `rs` in requests.

Generating RS is quite simple:

### **Python**

```py
import random
from string import ascii_letters, digits  # so we don't have to type [A-Za-z0-9] by hand

# this code works only on python 3.6 and above

possible_letters = ascii_letters + digits


def generate_rs(n: int) -> str:
    return ("").join(random.choices(possible_letters, k=n))
```

<!-- tabs:end -->

## UUID

[UUID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier) stands for Universally Unique IDentifier.
It has format of `aaaaaaaa-bbbb-cccc-dddd-eeeeeeeeee` and used to be sent as `uuid` in requests, but now the player ID (not to be confused with the account ID) is sent in its place instead.

It can be randomly generated using our `generate_rs()` function:

### **Python**

```py
def generate_uuid(parts: [int] = (8, 4, 4, 4, 10)) -> str:
    # apply generate_rs to each number in parts, then join results
    return ("-").join(map(generate_rs, parts))
```

## UDID

[UDID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UDID) is an abbreviation for Unique Device IDentifier that is sent as `udid` in requests.

On Android, your UDID is generated by making a UUIDv4 from your SSAID (`Settings.Secure.ANDROID_ID`). However, there's a common bug with the SSAID returning the value `9774d56d682e549c` on multiple devices. If the SSAID matches that string, a random UUIDv4 is generated instead. This UUID is also generated in the Java part of the code.

On Windows, the game tries to obtain either the thread or the process [SID](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/identity/ad-ds/manage/understand-security-identifiers) and removes all the dashes from it, which is a really long number starting with `S`. If it fails, the UDID is `NoUDID_`, followed by a random value from 0 to 1,000,000,000.

### **Python**

```py
import random


def generate_udid(start: int = 100_000, end: int = 100_000_000) -> str:
    return "S15" + str(random.randint(start, end)) + str(random.randint(start, end)) + str(random.randint(start, end)) + str(random.randint(start, end))
```
