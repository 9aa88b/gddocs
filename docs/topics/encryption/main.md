# Encryption in Geometry Dash

Geometry Dash client and servers use several encryptions and encodings when sending requests.

Main themes in GD are [Base64 encoding](topics/encryption/base64.md),
[CHK generation](topics/encryption/chk.md), [RS, UDID/UUID](topics/encryption/id.md),
[XOR cipher](topics/encryption/xor.md) and [Data zipping](topics/encryption/zip.md).
