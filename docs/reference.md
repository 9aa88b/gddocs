# Geometry Dash References

The **Geometry Dash** servers are based around one main HTTP server, rather than primarily through secondary sources or establishing a direct REST api for usage. All endpoints are stored over the `/database` folder, rather than the base.

## Server Responses

Most server repsonses are formatted in weird ways, not in more usual ways like **JSON**, or **XML**. Usually, they're formatted in a way that consists of `key:value`,  not really in a way that gives each key a name; but is more similar to an ID system. Most responses will use the splitters `:`, `|`, or `#`, the last two being mostly to split between multiple response strings, usually seen in filtering endpoing such at `getGJLevels` or `getGJUsers`.
